# Julia installation

Without silver bullet, Julia's features won't be easy to learn in Python! And I'm angry that Julia doesn't support single quotes. But don't worry, it's very easy to get started. Enter the topic:

## Installation

This shall be the easiest part. On [official website ](https://julialang.org/)download things and install.

Since I'm a macOS user, I shall take some screenshot showing you using it.

(I changed the two Julia app icons. The original image consists of three points (julia-1.4. APP) and four points (Julia pro-1.4.2. APP)

What is Julia 1.4? As you can see, the icon I changed shows exec, which means that this is actually a REPL.

And that Julia pro-1.4.2? ——Once again from the icon, it's an Atom.

Now, smart you, are finished downloading Julia. After downloading Julia (and installing), you can open a REPL (*Read-Eval-Print Loop*, a interactive programming environment) first, whether it's Julia pro or a separate Julia compiler. Similar to IPython for Python, Julia's repl supports basic code highlighting, document viewing and other functions. But Julia's repl is more powerful (I will explain this later on).

You should all be macOS/windows. If so, double-click Julia to open repl. In atom, there is Julia in the upper left corner. Click open terminal. If you don't want to open Julia with the default terminal, you can start it by executing the command "exec" to the path / contents / resources / Julia / bin / Julia "of Julia software (I don't know about windows).

If it's Linux, things are a little different.

You need to find the bin folder after downloading it, and then add it to your path environment variable. Later, you can start repl directly from the command line through the 'Julia' command. (I'm not going to talk more about this. After all, my stereotype tells me that you are powerful lol.)
